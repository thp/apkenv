apkenv
======

A compatibility layer for applications packaged as .apk.

Support website: http://thp.io/2012/apkenv/


Example module and .apk
=======================

An example module is provided in modules/trg2.c - you can use this module as a
basis to create your own modules. You can download the .apk that works with
this example module from:

softfp vs. hardfp
=================

Android is softfp.
Maemo 5 is softfp.
MeeGo 1.2 Harmattan is hardfp.

softfp and hardfp differ in the way functions with floating point arguments
get called. Trying to call a hardfp function with the softfp calling
convention will not work and likely result in a crash or worse. To avoid
this, you can add an attribute to function declarations to make sure that
the function accepts its parameters using the softfp calling convention,
like this:

    __attribute__((pcs("aapcs")))

There's a convenience #define in apkenv.h called "SOFTFP" with which you can
decorate all functions that are either in a native library (i.e. in
modules/) or that will be called from the native library (i.e. in compat/).
Please note that in theory this attribute is only required on functions that
pass float values in the arguments, but do it always to save you some
headaches.


Debugging crashes
=================

First of all, enable debugging in the makefile (set DEBUG=1). Then rebuild
to get a debug build with lots of debug output. You can then check which
symbols get mapped from where at the linker phase (e.g. apkenv x.apk | grep
'from libc') - in general, most libc functions must be mapped in order to
avoid problems (e.g. stdio functions don't work in Bionic libc, so we have
to hack around these issues - the same is true for memory (de-)allocation,
etc..).

When you have all relevant functions mapped, ltrace'ing apkenv can help you
find the library function in which it crashes - this will not list functions
from Bionic libs, but only from your system libraries (another reason why it
is usually a good idea to map system-level functions).
